  dialogue:
  - "Farmer:Hey, missus! Rare to see anyone around except me n\u2019 my family nowadays.
    You got somewhere to be or you got some time to spare to help an old man out?"
  - Dahlia:Certainly.
  - "Farmer:Thank you very much, then. If you\u2019d just take up that scythe right
    there and get ta hacking at those crops. No need to be too careful about it,
    most of \u2018em aren\u2019t good to eat anyways."
  - Dahlia:What happened to the crops?
  - "Farmer:Why? Haven\u2019t ya heard \u2018bout the crop disease \u2018round the
    whole kingdom? That\u2019s why there ain\u2019t no townsfolk left. Fools, thinkin\u2019
    they can outrun a famine."
  - Dahlia:Will you be traveling with them?
  - "Farmer:Nah, my family an\u2019 I are stayin\u2019 put. We\u2019ll weather it
    out, just like we always have. The ritual\u2019ll be soon, an\u2019 then the
    bad season will end."
  - Dahlia:Ritual?
  - "Farmer:Oh, yeah, the king\u2019s gatherin\u2019 up all the farm animals for
    a ritual to suppress the God of Death, since obviously the prick\u2019s been
    mucking up the yields."
  - "Farmer:Not sure why it\u2019s gotta be a ritual this time. Usually, the king\u2019ll
    just send offerings up to strengthen the God of Life. Offerings were workin\u2019
    just fine as far as I knew."
  - "Farmer:Now, git to it! These crops ain\u2019t gonna reap themselves!"
